> **An AI-powered accessibility ecosystem that bridges the digital and physical world using voice, vision, gesture, AR, and IoT to empower specially-abled, elderly, and illiterate users.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

HackCrypt: The Cosmic Cipher is a unified accessibility platform designed to make modern technology usable for **everyone**, especially:
- Visually impaired users
- Senior citizens
- Deaf and mute users
- Illiterate users
- People with locomotion disabilities

The project combines **AI, Computer Vision, Voice Interfaces, AR, and IoT** to enable inclusive interaction with both **software systems and real-world environments**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

- 96% of applications lack basic accessibility features  
- Most systems are designed only for able-bodied, tech-literate users  
- Existing assistive solutions are fragmented, expensive, and disability-specific  
- Blind and mobility-impaired users face major challenges in **indoor navigation** and **device control**  

Accessibility is treated as an add-on instead of a **fundamental right**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Sutradhar provides a **single, intelligent platform** that adapts to different disabilities using natural modes of interaction.

### Core Capabilities
- Voice-based system navigation
- Gesture-based controls
- Multilingual chatbot & voice assistant
- Sign language recognition
- Dyslexia-friendly reading support
- Indoor navigation assistance
- AR-based remote device control

The system is **software-first**, with **selective IoT hardware** only where it adds real-world value.
